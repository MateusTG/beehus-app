27/01/2026 05:27:39 
27/01/2026 05:27:39 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
27/01/2026 05:27:39   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
27/01/2026 05:27:39   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
27/01/2026 05:27:39    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
27/01/2026 05:27:39    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
27/01/2026 05:27:39      moved window is released in the new position.
27/01/2026 05:27:39   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
27/01/2026 05:27:39   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
27/01/2026 05:27:39   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
27/01/2026 05:27:39   periodic repaints.

27/01/2026 05:27:39 XFIXES available on display, resetting cursor mode
27/01/2026 05:27:39   to: '-cursor most'.
27/01/2026 05:27:39   to disable this behavior use: '-cursor arrow'
27/01/2026 05:27:39   or '-noxfixes'.
27/01/2026 05:27:39 using XFIXES for cursor drawing.

27/01/2026 05:27:39 Scroll Detection: -scrollcopyrect mode is in effect to
27/01/2026 05:27:39   use RECORD extension to try to detect scrolling windows
27/01/2026 05:27:39   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
27/01/2026 05:27:39   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
27/01/2026 05:27:39   errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-noscr'
27/01/2026 05:27:39   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
27/01/2026 05:27:39   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to

27/01/2026 05:27:39   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
27/01/2026 05:27:39   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
27/01/2026 05:27:39   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.

******************************************************************************
Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.
